Hi! I’m Giorgos, a senior Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://ntua.gr/).

I am currently completing my studies at NTUA. My thesis focused on shell benchmarking and was supervised by Prof. [Nikos Vasilakis](https://nikos.vasilak.is/) and Prof. [Georgios Gkoumas](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~goumas/).

Right now, I am also working as a Machine Learning Research Intern at [Archimedes RU](https://archimedesai.gr/en/) under the guidance of [Prof. Evaggelia Pitoura](https://archimedesai.gr/en/researchers/evaggelia-pitoura).

I am interested in operating systens, programming languages, and leveraging ML to build high-performance systems.

Beyond the above, I enjoy hiking, finding new music to listen to and reading books.
